When shutting off one instance, load balancer appropriately sends traffic to the functioning instance.
When both instances are shut off, load balancer cannot display files as expected.
However, when turning an instance back on, the load balancer takes a while to register the change, so it continues to
fail for about 10 seconds, then eventually starts serving the pages correctly again. We had trouble with the URL serving
caches pages, so we had to ctrl-F5 to really test the pages. Little idiosyncracies. All in all, balancer should be
functioning properly!
