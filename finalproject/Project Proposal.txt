Build IM/Messaging server using XMPP and Jabber/Pidgin as the front-end chat client. Secure with Fail2Ban. Use mysql database for XMP with high availability database clustering.
 
The effect on our user population should be minimal, as it will not effect VM availability to users. Fail2Ban might potentially shut out users but this is unlikely.
 
We will implement the following preventative security measures:
-install and configure Fail2Ban to prevent network attacks.
-ensure ufw plays nice with XMPP and lets chat messages through.
-ensure that XMPP does not introduce vulnerabilities in our system.
 
The work that needs to be completed for this project is:
-install and configure XMPP server
-install and configure mysql
-configure mysql database clustering on puppet agents???
-install chat client on a client system
-test if chat client can connect to XMPP server
-test if chat client can initiate IM/chat with another person
-install and configure Fail2Ban on XMPP server
-configure puppet to automatically configure XMPP, Fail2Ban and mysql across VMs
 
Client installation on Linux-based systems could be automated by creating a Puppet module for the Jabber client to install the Jabber client packages on each puppet agent.
 
We should document the configuration settings of the XMPP server and database cluster we set up. We should also create documentation for the user population to install a client, connect to the XMPP server, and start a chat with other users.
