Final Project Write-Up 

Goals: 
•	Build and configure XMPP OpenFire server for IMing/messaging 
•	Install and configure MySQL to use as embedded database for OpenFire 
•	Verify that IMing/messaging capabilities work from a client machine  
•	Install and configure Fail2Ban to prevent network attacks  
•	Automate Fail2Ban installation and configuration via Puppet 

Testing Methods: 
•	Installed Pidgin chat client on a client machine and verified that chat client could connect to XMPP 	server
•	Verified that two users (Steve and myself) could send and receive chat messages to each other using Pidgin 	chat client while connected to our XMPP server  
•	Verified that Fail2Ban automatically installed on all puppet agents using puppet modules 

User Impact: 
•	Gives users IM/messaging functionality which could improve communication and collaboration abilities 
•	The additional security Fail2Ban provides creates a more secure and stable environment which should result 	in less downtime, slowness, or compromises that might otherwise occur due to events such as brute force 	SSH attacks 
•	Short of users performing nefarious activities, Fail2Ban should not affect or prevent users from utilizing 	the chat functionality of the XMPP server 

Security Issues: 
•	MySQL has a number of security vulnerabilities that could be remediated by using a strong DB password, 	running the MySQL DB security script to disable settings such as anonymous logon, and allowing least 	privileged access to the databases
•	Administration of OpenFire is performed over the browser through an “admin console”. Ideally we should be 	using an SSL cert to access this console. 
•	Pidgin clients are currently connecting and passing credentials to the XMPP server over unencrypted 	plaintext. We should be using SSL/encryption. 
•	OpenFire uses Java, which has multiple security vulnerabilities.

Steps to Completion of Work: 
•	Installed Fail2Ban
•	Automated installation and configuration of rules via Puppet 
•	Installed MySQL on the server
•	Created MySQL database, MySQL user account/s, MySQL grants, and imported OpenFire schema 
•	Installed and configured OpenFire 
•	Tested connectivity between client and server using Pidgin chat client 

Maintenance/Automation: 
•	Keep OpenFire updated using Puppet
•	Keep Java updated using Puppet 
•	Keep OS updated using Puppet 
•	Configure and push Fail2Ban rules to agents using Puppet 
•	Ensure Fail2Ban rules are fine-tuned to prevent network attacks on our servers, especially for attacks our 	servers appear to be extra susceptible to. 
•	Manage Pidgin user accounts through OpenFire and audit periodically
